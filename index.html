                    I have started my Ph.D. program under the supervision of professor Ken Christensen. My main research
                    interests are Computer networks, especially Blockchain networks, their applications, as well as
                    performance evaluation of them. My current research is focusing on performance evaulation of

                            In my classroom, learning is an active, hands-on journey where students bridge the gap
                            between
                            theoretical concepts and real-world applications in computer networking. As a Teaching
                            Assistant
                            for computer network labs at the University of South Florida, I create an immersive learning
                            environment where students do more than just follow instructions—they engage, experiment,
                            and
                            problem-solve using industry-standard tools and equipment. Each session is designed to
                            simulate
                            real-world networking scenarios, helping students gain not just technical proficiency but
                            also
                            critical thinking and troubleshooting skills essential for their future careers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My approach to teaching is rooted in interactive and experiential learning. Rather than
                            simply
                            demonstrating concepts, I challenge students to take an active role in configuring routers
                            and
                            switches, analyzing network traffic using Wireshark, and diagnosing network issues hands-on.
                            For
                            example, in labs where students learn about VLANs and subnetting, I encourage them to design
                            their own network topologies and troubleshoot connectivity problems, simulating real IT
                            environments. This method fosters a deeper understanding of networking principles while also
                            developing students’ confidence in their technical abilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To reinforce learning, I incorporate collaborative activities and formative assessments.
                            Before
                            each lab, I provide a brief interactive discussion to connect theoretical concepts with the
                            day’s hands-on activities. During lab sessions, students work in teams to configure networks
                            using Ethernet cables, console cables, routers, and switches, applying protocols like DHCP,
                            ARP,
                            and TCP/IP in a practical setting. By engaging in peer discussions and collaborative
                            troubleshooting, students refine their problem-solving skills and reinforce their learning
                            through knowledge-sharing. Additionally, I integrate tools like Kahoot for quick quizzes to
                            assess understanding, ensuring that students grasp key networking concepts before moving on
                            to
                            more complex tasks.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Beyond technical knowledge, my goal is to cultivate adaptability, teamwork, and analytical
                            thinking—skills that extend beyond the classroom and into the professional IT world.
                            Networking
                            is dynamic, and I emphasize the importance of continuous learning by encouraging students to
                            analyze real network traffic patterns using Wireshark and compare them to live network
                            conditions. This approach transforms the lab into a space where students not only learn how
                            to
                            configure networks but also understand how and why networks function the way they do.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Education is not just about passing a course; it is about preparing students for success in
                            their careers and lifelong learning. By creating an engaging, interactive, and supportive
                            lab
                            environment, I strive to inspire students to approach networking with curiosity and
                            confidence.
                            As an educator, my role extends beyond instruction—I am a mentor, a guide, and a motivator,
                            ensuring that each student leaves the lab with not just technical expertise but also the
                            mindset
                            to innovate and lead in the ever-evolving field of computer networking.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In summary, my teaching philosophy is built on hands-on learning, collaboration, and
                            real-world
                            application, all aimed at empowering students to become skilled professionals. Through this
                            approach, I am committed to shaping the next generation of IT specialists who are not only
                            technically proficient but also equipped with the problem-solving mindset needed to excel in

                        <p>
                            As I step into the computer network lab, my goal is clear: to transform theoretical
                            networking
                            concepts into hands-on experiences that equip students with both technical proficiency and
                            problem-solving skills. My teaching approach is deeply rooted in engagement, critical
                            thinking,
                            and practical application. Students are not passive learners but active participants in
                            configuring routers and switches, analyzing packet flows with Wireshark, and troubleshooting
                            network issues as they would in real-world IT environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From the very first session, I establish an interactive and structured learning environment
                            where students feel encouraged to explore, ask questions, and collaborate. Each lab session
                            begins with a brief conceptual review to set the foundation, followed by a guided
                            demonstration
                            of network configurations and protocols in action. The bulk of the session is devoted to
                            hands-on exercises, where students work with Ethernet cables, console cables, switches, and
                            routers to implement networking tasks themselves. This structured approach ensures that
                            students
                            develop both theoretical understanding and practical expertise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <h3 class="mb-3">Engagement Through Hands-On Learning </h3>
                        <p>
                            One of my core teaching strategies is active engagement through hands-on learning.
                            Networking is inherently a practical field, and I ensure that students gain direct
                            experience configuring network devices and analyzing protocols in real time. For example, in
                            a lab on VLANs and subnetting, I ask students to design their own network topologies,
                            configure VLANs on switches, and verify connectivity using ping and traceroute commands.
                            Instead of providing them with step-by-step instructions, I encourage them to troubleshoot
                            independently, reinforcing problem-solving skills that are crucial in networking careers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To further enhance engagement, I integrate interactive quizzes and problem-based learning
                            scenarios. Tools like Kahoot allow me to assess students’ understanding in a low-pressure,
                            gamified manner, while real-world case studies prompt them to apply networking principles to
                            solve industry-relevant challenges. One memorable example was a lab where students had to
                            diagnose and fix misconfigured DHCP and static IP settings—simulating an actual IT
                            troubleshooting scenario.
                        </p>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        <h3 class="mb-3">Supporting Student Success Through Personalized Feedback
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Beyond teaching, I prioritize individualized support and feedback to ensure every student
                            can progress at their own pace. I recognize that students come into the lab with varying
                            levels of prior networking experience. To address this, I implement a combination of group
                            work and one-on-one guidance to cater to different learning speeds. Students who grasp
                            concepts quickly are encouraged to mentor their peers, fostering a collaborative learning
                            atmosphere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My feedback process is structured around detailed rubric-based assessments and constructive
                            guidance. Instead of simply marking errors, I explain why a particular configuration did not
                            work and encourage students to reflect on their mistakes. This approach not only helps them
                            learn from troubleshooting failures but also instills a growth mindset, preparing them for
                            the iterative problem-solving nature of IT careers.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The effectiveness of my teaching can be seen in the measurable growth of my students’ skills
                            and confidence. Many students who initially struggled with network configuration later
                            demonstrated strong troubleshooting abilities and independent thinking in final lab
                            assessments.

                        <p>
                            One particularly rewarding moment was when a student who had difficulty grasping subnetting
                            early in the semester successfully designed and implemented a complex IP addressing scheme
                            by the end of the course. Their lab report not only demonstrated technical mastery but also
                            included a thoughtful analysis of the challenges they overcame—a testament to the
                            effectiveness of active learning and iterative problem-solving.

                        <p>
                            Teaching is more than just delivering content—it is about inspiring curiosity, building
                            confidence, and equipping students with lifelong learning skills. My role as a TA extends
                            beyond technical instruction; I strive to create an engaging, supportive environment where
                            students can experiment, fail, learn, and grow. Networking is a field that demands
                            adaptability and continuous learning, and I model these principles by continuously refining
                            my own teaching strategies based on student feedback and new developments in networking
                            technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, my goal is to prepare students not just for exams, but for careers—giving them
                            the confidence to configure networks, analyze traffic, and troubleshoot real-world issues.
                            Through hands-on learning, interactive engagement, and personalized support, I aim to

                        <p>
                            As a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Network Lab at the University of South Florida, I
                            have continuously refined my instructional methods to enhance student engagement,
                            comprehension, and practical skill development. While traditional lab instruction often
                            emphasizes structured demonstrations and rote exercises, I have introduced innovative
                            strategies that transform the lab into a dynamic learning environment where students
                            actively construct their understanding of networking concepts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the challenges I initially faced was ensuring that students truly grasped the
                            practical implications of networking theories rather than merely replicating steps from lab
                            manuals. In early sessions, I noticed that while students followed instructions correctly,
                            their ability to troubleshoot or adapt to unexpected network behaviors was limited.
                            Recognizing this gap, I revised my teaching approach by integrating real-world
                            problem-solving scenarios. Instead of simply configuring network devices according to a
                            script, students were given network topology issues that mimicked real-life troubleshooting
                            situations. For example, they were asked to diagnose why a network connection was failing
                            between two routers despite correct configurations, pushing them to think critically and
                            apply theoretical knowledge in practical settings.

                            Additionally, I leveraged interactive and gamified learning techniques to maintain
                            engagement. To reinforce protocol analysis using Wireshark, I introduced a “Network Mystery
                            Challenge,” where students had to analyze captured packets to uncover a hidden network
                            misconfiguration. This approach not only made the learning experience more engaging but also
                            strengthened their analytical skills in protocol troubleshooting. The results were
                            evident—students displayed improved confidence in packet analysis and better retention of
                            networking principles.

                        <p>
                            Assessment and feedback mechanisms were another area where I implemented improvements.
                            Traditionally, lab assessments focused on the final output, but I shifted the emphasis to
                            the process by incorporating formative assessments. I introduced checkpoint evaluations
                            during lab activities, providing immediate, constructive feedback rather than waiting until
                            the end of the session. This iterative feedback loop allowed students to correct
                            misunderstandings in real-time, significantly enhancing their learning outcomes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Beyond technical instruction, I strive to cultivate leadership and collaboration skills
                            among students. I initiated peer-teaching moments, where students who successfully completed
                            a lab task would explain their approach to their peers. This not only reinforced their
                            understanding but also encouraged a collaborative learning culture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These continuous innovations in my teaching methodology have transformed the Computer
                            Network Lab into an environment that is not only educational but also intellectually
                            stimulating. By adopting a problem-solving mindset, integrating interactive learning
                            techniques, and fostering collaboration, I have created a lab experience that prepares
                            students not just for exams, but for real-world challenges in networking and IT.

                            Throughout my time as a Teaching Assistant for Computer Networks labs at USF, I have
                            consistently received positive student feedback. Below is a summary of some comments I received,
                            reflecting my dedication to delivering an engaging and supportive learning environment.

                                Her passion for teaching is evident—she is always prepared, patient, and eager to help.
                                The labs were well-structured and hands-on, making learning so much more interactive.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                She takes extra time to ensure every student understands the material. I never felt
                                left behind, and she was always available to answer questions both during and after
                                class.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Her use of practical examples and real network simulations made the lab extremely
                                useful. I feel much more confident in my networking skills because of her teaching.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                She encourages student participation and makes sure that no one is struggling alone.
                                She also provides career advice and guidance beyond the coursework, which I really
                                appreciated.
